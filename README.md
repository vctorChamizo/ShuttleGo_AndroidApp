# ShuttleGo-Android

Most of the traffic between european airports and hotels is caused by
private vehicles, it usually causes important traffic jams between these two.
Providing a low cost and efficient access to airports has become a fundamental
mobility issue for cities, so some minority transport methods are being promoted.

Shuttle bus is one of these new initiatives, which has become popular
during the last years, making companies offer this new type of service as an
alternative.

The goal of this bachelor thesis is showing a smartphone app that solves
the user’s problem when booking these kind of services, giving portability,
simplicity and quickness to the experience, properties that cannot be found in other
similar apps. This application works for both ways, passengers and drivers.
Although the project started as an idea only for airports, it’s scalable and can be
used to solve another transport situations.
